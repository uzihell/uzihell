Unfortunately as of the 9th of February my ponytown account has gotten permanently suspended

I am trying to get it back, if I don't I'm sorry but most of you will probably never see me again

(Edit [26th of february]) Pony town hasn't replied yet so I GUESS I'm fucked. I've been playing on a custom server called fantasytown so if you ever wanna talk to me just hope that I'm there
