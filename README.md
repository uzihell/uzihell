â†‘ me & bug irl :3

ðŸ‘¾ Hey I'm Uzi!!!! I'm part of fictionfolk (fictives, fictionkin, etc) and I'd like to be referred as Uzi Doorman .. most I'll explain is I'm plural :P

I'm almost always sitting with my husband so if you see me say hi!!!
I'm mostly friendly but IWC (Interact with Caution) + I do NOT roleplay, it doesn't matter if my pony is a cosplay, most of the characters are dear to me

THINGS I'm really not...fond of are Tutorial skins and Panic AU skins. 

If you use Tutorial skins I understand you're new and stuff but I'd rather see what an asshole would call a bad skin than the same eyesore over and over (+ most of them are uncredited)

Panic AU strict DNI (Do not Interact). If you're a fictionfolk of Panic AU just,, don't interact a lot, sorry it makes me uncomfortable
